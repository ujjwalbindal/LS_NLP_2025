# LS_NLP_2025
I am ujjwal Bindal Here are all the solutions to the assignment given in LS_NLP_2025
, don't see the 23b1811 folder, it's not working properly for assignment 2. I have uploaded a similar folder See that 


In week4, final project, i have given you code of model with metrics mentioned, i have only trained my model on 5% data, as training on whole data as i calculated would have taken me 90 hrs which was not possible, also i also tried wandb api but that was also taking very long time, so i didn't used in final code, this is just a prototype using which you can make more powerful models also, most of the work in this is done by me, only the formatting and commenting part is done by chatgpt.
