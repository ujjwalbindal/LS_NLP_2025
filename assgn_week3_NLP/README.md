Below is a detailed answer to your assignment, including a comprehensive explanation of the machine learning pipeline, theory, complete Python code with error handling, and discussion of challenges and solutions.

Sentiment Analysis Pipeline Using Hugging Face
Pipeline Explanation
This pipeline performs sentiment analysis (positive or negative classification) on the IMDb dataset using Hugging Face’s transformers and datasets libraries. The workflow is as follows:

Dataset Loading: The IMDb dataset is accessed via datasets, which provides a large, labeled corpus for binary sentiment classification.

Preprocessing: Text data is tokenized using the BertTokenizer corresponding to bert-base-uncased. Tokenization converts raw text into input IDs and attention masks suitable for BERT.

Model Fine-Tuning: A pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) is fine-tuned for sequence classification. Fine-tuning adapts BERT’s general language understanding to the specific sentiment analysis task.

Evaluation: The model’s performance is measured using accuracy and F1-score, which are standard metrics for classification tasks.

Model Saving and Inference: The fine-tuned model is saved for future use and demonstrated on a sample input.

Design choices:

BERT is chosen for its strong performance on text classification tasks.

The Hugging Face ecosystem simplifies dataset handling, tokenization, and model training, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

Anticipated challenges:

Computational requirements: Fine-tuning BERT is resource-intensive; using a GPU is recommended.

Data preprocessing: Handling long texts and ensuring correct label mapping are crucial.

Error handling: The code includes checks for missing dependencies, dataset loading errors, and model saving/loading issues.


Error Handling Steps and Theory
Imports: All critical imports are wrapped in try-except blocks to catch missing dependencies and guide the user to install them.

Device Selection: The script checks for GPU availability and falls back to CPU if necessary.

Dataset Loading: Errors in loading the IMDb dataset are caught, and the script exits gracefully if loading fails.

Tokenizer and Model Loading: The script checks for errors when loading the tokenizer and model, ensuring that any issues (e.g., internet connectivity, missing files) are reported.

Tokenization: The dataset mapping is wrapped in a try-except block to handle data-related issues.

Training and Evaluation: Training and evaluation steps are protected against runtime errors, such as out-of-memory conditions.

Model Saving/Loading: Errors during saving/loading are handled, preventing silent failures.

Inference: The prediction function includes error handling to manage unexpected input or model issues.

Challenges and Solutions
Computational Cost: Fine-tuning BERT is resource-intensive. To address this, the code uses a subset of the training data for demonstration and recommends using a GPU for full-scale training.

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization ensures all texts are of uniform length (via truncation and padding). The script also checks for and handles label mapping.

Error Handling: Extensive use of try-except blocks ensures that errors are reported clearly and the script fails gracefully, aiding debugging and reproducibility.
